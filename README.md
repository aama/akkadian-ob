Old Babylonian is a variety of the Semitic Akkadian language-group, a closely related set of geographically and chronologically differentiated language varieties attested in written (cuneiform) sources from Mesopotamia (roughly, present-day Iraq) from the middle of the third millennium to the last centuries B.C.E. Old Babylonian as documented here is the standard variety of the language used in Southern Mesopotamia, centered around the political capitol Babylon during the first half of the second millennium B.C.E. There is a huge scholarly literature on Old Babylonian. The source followed here is the excellent pedagogical grammar, Huehnergard1997.
